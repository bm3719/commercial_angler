Commercial Angler
=================

    Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-west died away;
    Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;
    Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;

                                 Home Thoughts, from the Sea - Robert Browning 

Overview
========

Commercial Angler combines the excitement of deep sea fishing with the proud 
achievement of successful entrepreneurship in the commercial fishing 
industry. In the modern marketplace, global demand for ever-increasing 
amounts and varieties of edible seafood has resulted in rising prices. As a 
result, ambitious commercial anglers like yourself are setting out to sea to 
fill this demand, eager to begin converting marine biomatter into large piles 
of money.

Untried anglers should beware, however. The source of your profits will 
vigorously defend itself from being taken into your possession. As the marine 
lifeforms whose bodies you need to collect to exchange for money won't 
cooperate willingly, you will have to seize them by physical force. This 
process can be dangerous, especially when using inferior equipment. Thus, 
mastery of fishing and sailing skills are as much key to your continued 
survival as they are a part of your job. The open sea is an unforgiving 
environment, and its inhabitants battle for mortal stakes. 

Player Guide
============

Getting Started
---------------

When you start a new game, you'll only have a wooden log to sail in and your 
bare hands for which to assault fish. As you collect and sell catch, you'll be 
able to afford better weapons and ships. During these first few days, be 
careful not to attack creatures too much more powerful than you. Judging 
whether a creature is out of your league is part of being successful in the 
fishing industry. Use a sensible combination of knowledge of marine biology 
and an evaluation of your current  HP and equipment. Your character may 
occasionally react to creatures he finds particularly fearsome as well. If in 
doubt, simply continue patrolling - better to lose a few dollars on a prize 
catch than your life, after all. You may also flee from a battle not going 
your way. The quality of your vessel also limits how far out to sea you can 
go, so the lower level the ship, the lower the chance of meeting more powerful 
creatures. 

For the chronically impatient, the `File | Quick Start' menu option will start 
you off with some money and decent equipment.

Seaport Services
----------------

Should your ship sustain serious damage or your cargo hold be full of 
valuable fish, you should head back to port. Once in port, you will patch up  
any damage to your ship automatically. Afterwards, you can visit the Hyannis 
Cannery to exchange the fruits of your labor for US currency. Once you've 
collected enough, you can visit the Hyannis Shipyard where you can reinvest 
this money into your fishing enterprise. Here, you can upgrade or downgrade 
your ship or weapon, receiving credit on your purchase by exchanging your 
current equipment during the transaction.

Open-Ended
----------

Like most simulations, Commercial Angler doesn't have any pre-defined goals. 
Play all day and night nonstop to see how quickly you can get the best ship 
and weaponry available. Or, relax and bask in the endless blue pixels of the 
northern Atlantic. You could open a text editor in another window and keep a 
captain's log of your adventures (both in-game and imaginary) or the types of 
existential musings that long, lonely days at sea often engender in an 
introspective mind such as yours. As a fan of maritime profit-making, you're 
probably smart enough to come up with plenty of your own ideas. 

Revision History
================

Version 0.1: Initial release.

Notes
=====

Forthcoming features: Loading and saving your game, custom character naming.

Other possible future features: Improved graphics, RPG-like elements such as 
player levels and stats, end-game bosses, ability to eat fish, drop tables 
besides just corpses, confirmation beeps when buying stuff, uploading memorial 
files to a web-based CGI script, and maybe a rewrite in a different language.

For those who can't figure it out: Yes, this isn't a serious game. It was just
tossed together in a couple days to refresh my C# memory prior to a job
search.  I'll try to turn it into something actually fun someday, maybe.
